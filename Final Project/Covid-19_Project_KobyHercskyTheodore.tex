\subsection{The topic I will be researching and addressing is the
vaccination rate for the Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson and Johnson
vaccines to determine which companies' vaccine is being taken and or
accessible in each state. While also researching into death rates of
Covid-19 by using variable such as sex, age, race, education, and the
state the individual was living in. These statistics will help shine
some light on the current pandemic and see the demographics on the
current death rates and what vaccines are being taken and the rate of
vaccination in each state. While also determining who is currently dying
from the virus. As I feel as if this is a topic that has affected
everyone in the world to some extent over the past year and can help
educate individuals on which vaccine has been distributed in their state
and the United States the most and what the death rate is in regard to
these variables. As the current problem we are dealing with is who is
currently at the highest risk of death and should you be getting a
vaccine and if so which one should you get? In our findings we will see
that this topic can be seen as a data science problem as we have mass
amounts of data that can be sifted and analyzed through the use of R
Studios to help our current
problem.}\label{the-topic-i-will-be-researching-and-addressing-is-the-vaccination-rate-for-the-pfizer-moderna-and-johnson-and-johnson-vaccines-to-determine-which-companies-vaccine-is-being-taken-and-or-accessible-in-each-state.-while-also-researching-into-death-rates-of-covid-19-by-using-variable-such-as-sex-age-race-education-and-the-state-the-individual-was-living-in.-these-statistics-will-help-shine-some-light-on-the-current-pandemic-and-see-the-demographics-on-the-current-death-rates-and-what-vaccines-are-being-taken-and-the-rate-of-vaccination-in-each-state.-while-also-determining-who-is-currently-dying-from-the-virus.-as-i-feel-as-if-this-is-a-topic-that-has-affected-everyone-in-the-world-to-some-extent-over-the-past-year-and-can-help-educate-individuals-on-which-vaccine-has-been-distributed-in-their-state-and-the-united-states-the-most-and-what-the-death-rate-is-in-regard-to-these-variables.-as-the-current-problem-we-are-dealing-with-is-who-is-currently-at-the-highest-risk-of-death-and-should-you-be-getting-a-vaccine-and-if-so-which-one-should-you-get-in-our-findings-we-will-see-that-this-topic-can-be-seen-as-a-data-science-problem-as-we-have-mass-amounts-of-data-that-can-be-sifted-and-analyzed-through-the-use-of-r-studios-to-help-our-current-problem.}}

from these statistics alone not taking into account any other variable

individual dying from the virus. Also, you might be wondering should I
get a shot and if yes which one should I get? Well, we are going to look
